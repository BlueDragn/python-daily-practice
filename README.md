# Python Daily Practice

This repository is my personal Python toolbox.

## Purpose
- Strengthen core Python problem-solving
- Practice DSA in an engineer-oriented way (clarity > tricks)
- Build small, real-world micro tools
- Improve code quality through refactoring
- Maintain daily consistency with Python

This repo is not a showcase project.
It is a long-term practice and revision space.

## How to Use This Repo
I work in this repository daily for 30–40 minutes.

Each session focuses on ONE of the following:
- Writing a small Python script
- Solving one DSA problem (with explanation)
- Building or extending a micro project
- Refactoring existing code for clarity
- Debugging broken or edge-case scenarios

Consistency matters more than volume.

## Repository Structure
- `core_python/` — file I/O, error handling, scripting fundamentals
- `dsa/` — data structures & algorithms for reasoning (not speed)
- `micro_projects/` — small, real-world tools
- `refactoring/` — before/after code improvements

## Guidelines
- One task per day
- No over-engineering
- Prefer readability over cleverness
- Explain *why* a solution works
- Behavior must remain the same during refactoring

## Long-Term Goal
This repository will serve as:
- My Python revision base
- A personal reference of patterns I trust
- Proof of consistent engineering practice

## Daily Work Rotation (Practical & Sustainable)

I rotate my daily practice to cover different engineering skills without burnout.
Each session is short (30–40 minutes) and focused on **one thing only**.

### Weekly Rotation Pattern

| Day | Focus |
|-----|------|
| Monday | Core Python scripting (file I/O, functions, error handling) |
| Tuesday | DSA (one small problem, clarity over tricks) |
| Wednesday | Micro project (build or extend a small tool) |
| Thursday | Refactoring (improve existing code without changing behavior) |
| Friday | DSA or debugging practice |
| Saturday | Micro project continuation or completion |
| Sunday | Light review or rest (no pressure) |

### Rules I Follow
- One task per day
- No rushing to finish
- Prefer readable code over clever code
- Small progress every day beats long gaps
- This repo is for consistency, not perfection

If a day is missed, I continue with the next day — no catching up.
