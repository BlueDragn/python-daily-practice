# Python Daily Practice

This repository is my personal Python toolbox.

## Purpose
- Strengthen core Python problem-solving
- Practice DSA in an engineer-oriented way (clarity > tricks)
- Build small, real-world micro tools
- Improve code quality through refactoring
- Maintain daily consistency with Python

This repo is not a showcase project.
It is a long-term practice and revision space.

## How to Use This Repo
I work in this repository daily for 30–40 minutes.

Each session focuses on ONE of the following:
- Writing a small Python script
- Solving one DSA problem (with explanation)
- Building or extending a micro project
- Refactoring existing code for clarity
- Debugging broken or edge-case scenarios

Consistency matters more than volume.

## Repository Structure
- `core_python/` — file I/O, error handling, scripting fundamentals
- `dsa/` — data structures & algorithms for reasoning (not speed)
- `micro_projects/` — small, real-world tools
- `refactoring/` — before/after code improvements

## Guidelines
- One task per day
- No over-engineering
- Prefer readability over cleverness
- Explain *why* a solution works
- Behavior must remain the same during refactoring

## Long-Term Goal
This repository will serve as:
- My Python revision base
- A personal reference of patterns I trust
- Proof of consistent engineering practice
